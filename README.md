# Local SEO Performance Hub – MVP

## Overview
Local SEO Performance Hub is a SaaS platform that helps local businesses track and improve their **online visibility** in one place.  

The MVP delivers a **Visibility Score (0–100)** based on:
- Local keyword rankings
- Google reviews
- Directory/citation listings

Target users:
- Local SMBs (dentists, lawyers, plumbers, med spas, restaurants)
- Agencies managing multiple local SEO clients

---

## Problem It Solves
Today, SMBs need 3–5 different tools just to answer one question:  
**“Are we visible locally?”**

- Rank tracking is one tool.  
- Review monitoring is another.  
- Citations are somewhere else.  
- Reports take hours every month.  

Local SEO Performance Hub bundles these into a **single dashboard + weekly report**.

---

## MVP Goals
- Deliver a **Visibility Score** dashboard.  
- Track up to **10 keywords** per location.  
- Pull reviews from Google Business Profile.  
- Check listings on top 5 directories.  
- Send a simple weekly PDF/email report.  

Success = 10 paying beta users (€49–97/month) within 6–8 weeks.
